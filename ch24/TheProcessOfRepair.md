# CHAPTER 24
## THE PROCESS OF REPAIR
修缮的历程

Next, several acts of building, each one
done to repair and magnify the product
of the previous acts, will slowly generate
a larger and more complex whole than
any single act can generate.

有些建造行为,
是用来修缮和改进之前行为结果的,
然后, 将慢慢形成更加复杂和庞大的整体,
这是任何一次单一建造行为所无法造就的.


> We know now, how a single act of building works.
We know that any person can lay out a building for
himself; that any group of people can do the same;
and we know h0w the builders can then carry Oul a .
process of conslruction, which will mmake a unified or-
ganic whole, out of the stakes marked on the ground.

>   Now we shall see how several acts of building, in
a r0w, will generale an even more coherent and more .
complex whole, piecemeal- -by making sure that every
acl conlribuies to lhe order of lhe previous acts.


In theory, according to chapter 18, every act of building
is, with respect to its larger context, an act of repair: a part
of the much larger process in which several acts together
generate the larger wholes from which a building complex
or a town iS made.
But so far we have not had an opportunity to see this
clearly- -because in chapters 19-23, we have been paying
attention to the individual creative act as an act which .
makes something new.
Now we shall change the focus, and pay attention to ;
each act, as an act of repair, within the larger whole.


    No building is ever perfect.

Each building, when it is first built, is an attempt to make
a self-maintaining whole con figuration. .
But our predictions are invariably wrong. People use
buildings differently from the way they thought they
would. And the larger the pieces become, the more serious


### THE WAY

The process of design, in the mind's eye, or on the site,
is an attempt to simulate in advance， the feeling and
events which will emerge in the real building, and to
create a configuration which is in repose with respect to
these events.
But the prediction is all guesswork; the real events
which happen there are always at least slightly diferent;
and the larger the building is, the more likely the guesses
are to be inaccurate.

> Ii is therefore necessary to keep changing the brwild-
ings, according to the real events which acmvally hap-
pen there.

And the larger the complex of buildings, neighborhood, or
town, the more essential it is for it to be built up gradually,
from thousands of acts, self-correcting acts, each one im-
proving and repairing the acts of the others.

> Suppose, for instance, lhat some corner of your house
is nol as alive as you would like.

For example, suppose I look at the house, and realize that its garden iS not working properly as a HALF-HIDDEN
GARDEN, because although it is to one side of the house,
there is not enough protection between the garden and
the street. It needs some kind of wall.
And, suppose that I go further, and bearing in mind
that work needs to be done to mend the barrier between
the garden and the street, I examine the garden from the
point of view of PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, and

48o
-----------------------------------------

find it missing. Suppose that I decide I need to build a
small brick terrace, at one side of my liouse, where it
touches the garden, in order to repair this gap.
Now, if I have already decided that some kind of wall
needs to be built to protect the garden where it is too
open, it is only natural that I shall try to make the miss-
ing terrace in some way to link it to this missing wall.
In short, when I get a chance to start mending the
garden, I can mend both these defective patterns with the
same act of building. And the repairs I make are not just
“repairs,”but new designs, complex themselves, between
the crevices of the first design.

> Or suppose that you have brill a small laboratory
bsuilding.


It has a kitchen, a library, four labs, and a main entrance.
You want to add a fth laboratory to it, because you need
more space.
Don't look for the best place right away. First, look at
the existing building, and see what is wrong with it. There
is a path where tin cans collect; a tree which is a beautiful
tree, but somehow no one uses it; one of the four labs is
always empty, there is nothing obviously wrong with it,
but somehow no one goes there; the main entrance has
no places to sit comfortably; the earth around one corner
of the building is being eroded.
Now, look at all these things which are wrong, and
build the fifth lab in such a way that it takes care of all
these problems, and also does, for itself, what it has to do.

481
-----------------------------------------


> Can you see how rich and various the parts of the
bilding zwill be, when they are built like this?


The ffth lab will be unique, unlike any of the other labs.
But not because you try hard to make it subtle, or beauti-
ful, or arty. It comes about in the most obvious way, just
because you are trying to be practical. Can you imagine
how hard it is to make one little laboratory, about 20 feet
by 20 feet, repair all these different problems at once?
It isn't impossible; but to do it you will have to stretch
it here, extend it there, give it a special window here to
make the tree more useful, bring the path around it here,
to make the path with the tin cans less deserted, give it a
door at just this spot, to help create 2 pleasant corner in
the entrance, where people can wait.
So the richness and uniqueness of this little addition
comes about in the simplest and most practical way pos-
sible. It happens almost by itself, just because you pay
attention to the defects in the present building, and try
hard to repair them.
> Each act of bvilding, wohrich differeniates a part of
space, needs to be followed soon by further acts of
building, zwhich further differentiate the space to make
it still more wohole.


This is commonplace in nature: and indeed, it is just this
which always manages to make the parts of nature whole.

Consider the leaves on a tree. At frst sight it seems as
though the leaves are solid, and the air between the leaves

482
-----------------------------------------


is merely space. But the air between the leaves js as much
a part of nature as the leaves themselves: it takes on shape
as strongly as the leaves themselves; and like the leaves, it
is given its shape by the infuences which work on it.

Each leaf has a shape which is determined by the need
for strength, the growth of the material, and the Aowing
of the sap within the leaf. But the air between two leaves is
given its shape as definitely. If the leaves are too close to-
gether, the air between the leaves cannot act as a channel
for the sunlight which the leaves need; and there may not
be enough breeze there to ventilate the leaves; if the leaves
are too far apart, the distribution of the leaves on the
twigs and branches is inefficient, and the tree will not get
enough sunlight to support it. Every part you look at is
not only whole itself, but is part of a larger whole, has
wholes around it, and is itself made up entirely of w holes.

This is essential to the way that nature works: and all
of it is generated by the processes of successive differentia-
tions, each one helping to fll gaps, and mend gaps in the

> W hen things are first built, the gaps between the parts
are often left unwhole.
In the kind of world we have today, almost half the places
in a building or a town are places“in between' the places
w here you are meant to be.

The dark narrow space between two houses, the corner
of the kitchen which no one can reach, the area between
the train tracks and the next door industry- -these are

483
-----------------------------------------


obvious examples of places which are literally forgotten
and left over.

And there are more remarkable examples, where spaces
are actually intended to be left over.

Think about streets with cars parked on them, park-
ing lots, long corridors, waiting rooms, the path between
the front door and the street, the garage, the closet under-
neath the stairs, the bathroom, the windowless front hall
of the house. All these places are made with the mistaken
notion that you are only there in limbo, in between the
moments of living- -as if they were way-stations between
the few places where you are actually meant to be alive. .

> But these gaps must be healed and made as whole as
the parts On either side of them.

In a town or building which is whole, there are no places
like this; and in a life which is truly lived, there are no
moments like this either.

In a life which is truly lived, there are no moments
which are“in between”or“out of life"- -every moment
is lived fully. 'The Zen master says “when I eat, I eat;
when I drink, I drink; when I walk, I walk." A build-
ing or a town which is alive, has the same quality.

In a building or a town which is alive, and which sup-
ports a life that is fully lived, there are no places which
are way-stations between moments of living; every place
is made in such a way that life can be savored fully there.
Every square inch of it has some valuable purpose, and is
able to support some moment in a person's life which is .

484
-----------------------------------------


truly lived; and for this reason every part of it is whole,
and every place between two wholes is also whole.

Slowly, as the “process of repair repairs the gaps be-
tween the wholes, the structure becomes complete and
whole at every level. .

> This goes vastly beyond the normal concepion of
repair. .

In the commonplace use of the word repair, we assume
that when we repair something, we are essentially trying
to get it back to its original state. This kind of repair is
patching, conservative, static.

But in this new use of the word repair, we assume, in-
stead, that every entity is changing constantly: and that at
every moment we use the defects of the present state as
the starting point for the definition of the new state.

> W hen we repair something in this new sense, we as
sume that we are going to transform it, lhat new
wholes will be born, that, indeed, the enire whole .
which is being repaired woill become a different whole
as the result of the repair.

In this sense, the idea of repair is creative, dynamic, open.

It assumes that we are constantly led to the creation of
new wholes, by paying attention to the defects in the exist-
ing wholes, and trying to repair them. It is still true that
every act helps to repair some larger, older whole: but the
repair not only patches it- -it also modifes it, transforms

485
-----------------------------------------


it, sets it on the road to becoming something else, entirely
new.

> In lhis framework, we gain an enirely new view of
the process through which a sequence of acts of build-
ing generales a whole.

Broadly, what is happening is that there is, at each stage
in the life of any part of the environment， a w holeness
which is specific to that moment in its life: and that each
new act of building, provided that it is done with an eye
to making the overall whole still more whole, more alive,
will transform that whole, and gradually give birth to
new wholes.

In this sense, then, the idea of repair explains both how
we can mend past defects in things, and also, at the same
time, how it is possible to make and remake the world
So that the cooperation of a number of acts of building, in
sequence, also creates wholes which are complete, and live, .
at every moment of their history- -yet always giving way,
under the process of repair, to even newer wholes, which
once again remake themselves at the next stage of the
repair.

> In order I0 see this clearly, let us imagine that there
is somewhere a building complex, grorwing, over lime.


Step by step, each act of building, w hich contributes to the
growing whole, is also helping to repair or heal what is
already there.

486
-----------------------------------------


Specifically, let us imagine a cluster of houses growing
over time.

> Each house starts with a small beginning- no more
than a family kitchen, with a bed alcove of one end,
and a kitchen counter.

AIl in all, no more than 300-500 square feet to start with. .

> Then, for the first few years, people add 100-200
square feet more each year.

First a bedroom perhaps; another bedroom; a workshop ;
a garden terrace; a full bathing room; arcades and
porches; studio; a bigger sitting room, with a big fire-
place; a garden shed.

And, at the same time common things are also built;
they plant an avenue of trees; a small gazebo; a shared
outdoor room; paving on the paths; closed-in garages; a
communal workshop; a small fountain or a swimming

> As the buildings reach maurily, the incremens get
smaller.

A bench; a sitting wall; a roof over the entrance; a rail-
ing on the terrace upstairs; a stair to the roof; a fishpond;
a baywindow; an extra gate; a vegetable patch; a wall of
shelves; a garden seat around the trunk of a growing
tree....


487
-----------------------------------------

> Yet, at the same time, collectively, the houses begin
to generate the larger patterns which define the
cluster.

Each person begins to work with his neighbor, first the
neighbor on one side, then the neighbor on the other side;
and together they try to make the space between their
houses beautiful. Of course, they start by eliminating obvi-
ous coniicts between windows, or cases where one house
takes the sun from the next man's garden; but they also
work out details according to the detailed patterns. For
example, one group of people decide to make their en-
trances open off a small public garden, with a tree, and
with an outdoor seat in it, facing the sun, and from which
people can watch the distant outdoor room, according to
the patterns TREE PLACES, OUTDOOR SEATS, and PUBLIC
OUTDOOR ROOM.

For example, path shape says that a path must be a
place, almost like a room, partly enclosed, with a middle,
so that people feel cornfortable staying there, not just
walking through. Each group uses this pattern to make
the paths outside their houses better shaped, with seats in
them; and the pattern even affects the exact shape of the
boundary wall where the houses meet the paths.

And PRIVATE TERRACE on THE STREET says that each
house should have a private terrace, near its living room,
but placed so that one can see from it, into the public
space of the street beyond, and wave or say hello to some-
one out there, without the privacy of the house being dis-

488
-----------------------------------------



turbed. Each of the houses has such a terrace, and the
way these terraces make the paths alive is also discussed
and modified by the groups at each end of the cluster.

> Slowly, at every level, the arran gement of wholes
becomes so dense that there are no gaps between the
wholes: every parl, and every parl between tw0o parts,
is whole.

In a house, the garden round the house is positive; the
boundaries between house and garden are again positive.

The thickness of the walls is positive; the wall which
forms the enclosure between terrace and garden is again
positive; a seat; while the interior walls are places t0o
(shelves, niches, etc.); within the house, each room is, of
course, a place; but to make this happen, each one has
windows on two sides- - -with the result that the rooms take
on an odd configuration, in plan- -and every place be-
tween the rooms is once again a place. At the level of con-
struction, we find the same. Every room has its corners .
marked by columns. Each column is again a visible co-
herent thing; the columns which stand free have places
around them once again; each column is itself made in
such a way that the places where it joins other entities, are
once again entities: columns and feet.

> So, the houses get their form, both as a group, and
separately, as individuals, from the gradual accreion
of a number of small separate acts.

490
-----------------------------------------

The bench is placed, to form a terrace; the extra bed-
room helps to shield the garden from the neighborhood ;
the paving on the path is placed in such a way that it de-
fines the entrance transition, and forms a contour edge to
help prevent erosion from the rain; the extra growing
house helps to form common land outside the house; the
avenue of trees helps to form a park in the common land;
the garages not only shield the cars, but also help to form
gateways into the cluster. 。。。

Every smnall act helps not only to increase the space, but
also makes a contribution to the larger patterns which are
needed there.

And finally, the common character of the cluster of
houses grows, without control, simply from the accumula-
tion of the individual acts- - -because each act of building is .
conceived as something which not only does good for it-
self, but also has the obligation to help generate the whole.

> In chapter I9 I argued that an or"gamic whole could
only be created by a diferentiating process.

I explained that only a process of differentiation, because
it defines the parts within the whole, can generate a natu-
ral thing; because only this kind of process can shape parts
individually, according to their position in the whole.

> We see now that there is a second, complementary
process which produces the same results, but works
piecemeal, instead.

491
-----------------------------------------

When a place grows, and things are added to it, gradu-
ally, being shaped as they get added, to help form larger
patterns, the place also remains whole at every stage- -but
in this case the geometric volume of the whole keeps chang-
ing, because there is an actual concrete aggregation of
matter taking place.

> T his process, like the simple differenialing process, is
able to make wholes in which lhe paris are shaped ac-
cording to their place.
But this process is still more powerful: because it
can make groups of buildings which are lar ger and
more complex.
And il is more powerful, above all, because il leaves
    no mistakes: because the gaps get filled, the small
things that are wrong are gradually corrected, and
finally, the wehole is so smooth and relaxed, that il
will seem as though it had been there forever. It has
no roughness aboui it, it simply lies there stretched
OUt in time.
